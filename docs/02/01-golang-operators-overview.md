# Golang Operators

## Prereqisites

If you are not familiar with Go, atleast go through this resource: https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1

## Agenda

This is what we're going to do: 

- We are going to embellish that illustration of the _Reconciliation Cycle_ we saw in the [introduction](../01/01-introduction.md#how-do-operators-work) with Golang Semantics.

- We'll explain some of the fundamentals, specifically on CRDS, Controllers, and the Controller Runtime 

- We'll discuss some of the options you have in regards to selecting a Golang Operator Framework to work with. 

- We'll talk about leveraging tooling to help you avoid writing tons of boiler plate code -- we may even try to explain the boilerplate to answer any potential inquiries you might have as we go through it. 

Afterwards, you will be ready to take the plunge with the author in a guided walkthrough.
